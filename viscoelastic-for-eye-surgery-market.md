<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Viscoelastic for Eye Surgery Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Sodium Hyaluronate</li><li>Hydroxypropyl Methyl Cellulose</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The viscoelastic eye surgery market primarily comprises two key types: Sodium Hyaluronate and Hydroxypropyl Methyl Cellulose (HPMC). Sodium Hyaluronate is a naturally occurring polymer known for its biocompatibility and high viscoelasticity, making it ideal for maintaining eye structure during procedures like cataract surgery. HPMC, a synthetic polymer, offers similar properties but is often preferred for its ease of handling and stability. Both types serve to protect ocular tissues, facilitate surgical maneuvers, and enhance overall procedural outcomes.</p></p>
