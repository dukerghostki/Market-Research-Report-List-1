<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The 2-Way 2-Position Solenoid Valves Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Normally Closed Type</li><li>Normally Open Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The market for 2-way 2-position solenoid valves is divided into normally closed (NC) and normally open (NO) types. Normally closed solenoid valves remain shut when not energized, allowing fluid flow only when activated, making them ideal for applications requiring safety and leak prevention. Conversely, normally open solenoid valves allow fluid flow when de-energized, closing upon activation, suitable for systems that need a default open state. Both types are widely used in fluid control in various industries, including HVAC, manufacturing, and irrigation.</p></p>
